# lab 5 backend

For this backend, I followed the lab instructions and it was mostly smooth sailing! Going back and changing the username field forced me to review all the steps more, which made me understand the models better. I really wanted to extend the api but did not have time :cry:. I'd like to try adding comments, more information to each user, or perhaps another model that extends this into a full app!
